Burger is an app built with Express that uses an ORM to handle data in mySQL

Users can add any burger they want and it will show up under "To Eat".  They can choose to "Devour It!" and the burger will move down to another location.  They also have the ability to delete a burger they don't want anymore, and users can also change their mind and eat a burger "Later".  All the data is added to mySQL
